# Front End test for Springload

I started out with an EDA boilerplate, just so that I didn't waste any time on the scaffolding. I also chose to use Material-UI because I'm familiar with it and didn't want to get bogged down in minor CSS changes on such a short timeframe, because I know I'm partial to fretting over details (see below!).

An extra benefit of using Material-UI is that it handles some basic accessibility and browser support straight out of the box.

I took a little over 2 hours, because I spent a bunch of time focussed on why the Animals label wouldn't line up with the rest of them, before deciding that it was more important that it validates than lines up.

It's useable on a mobile screen, but not truly responsive because the font is tiny, and I didn't get time to do any testing.
